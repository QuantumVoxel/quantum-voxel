A voxel game that aims to do stuff differently.

## Download & Play
You can [open in the Itch.io App](itch://games/2401600) to play it. The link requires [the itch.io app](https://itch.io/app).  
Downloading & running manually is discouraged due to issues with the game closing. So having a way to force close the game is recommended. (E.g., running from cmd/terminal or running with the launcher)

## Build From Source
*Coming Soon* <!--Or maybe not? Who knows lmao-->

## Making Mods
See the [Quantum Voxel Example Mod](https://gitlab.com/ultreon/quantum/java-example-mod).
> **Note**
> Be aware that large refactors may occur due to the game still being in pre-alpha phase.
